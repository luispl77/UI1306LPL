# UI1306LPL
SSD1306 128x64 OLED display UI library for creating simple menus with cursor and assigning functions.

Prerequisits: You will have to install Adafruit's SSD1306 library and Adafruit GFX's library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306
(I recomended to using Library Manager in arduino IDE to install all prerequisits at once)

See the `example_UI.ino example in examples folder.
