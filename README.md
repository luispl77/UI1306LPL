# UI1306LPL
SSD1306 128x64 OLED display UI library for creating simple menus with cursor and assigning functions.

Prerequisites:
You'll have to install Adafruit's SSD1306 library and Adafruit GFX's library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306
(I recommend using the Library Manager in Arduino IDE to install all prerequisites at once).

See the `example_UI.ino` example in examples folder.
